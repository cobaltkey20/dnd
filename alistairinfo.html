    <h1>Alistair McCallaigh</h1>
    <b>Nickname/Alias:</b> Allie <br>
    <b>Race:</b> Human <br>
    <b>Age:</b> 23 <br>
    <b>Alignment:</b> Neutral Good <br>
    <b>Class:</b> Cleric &amp; Hospitaler <br>
    <b>Bio:</b><br>
      Coming from a small town in Dennar, Alistair is a fairly inexperienced cleric of Istus. As the son of a preacher and a folk healer, 
      he had a rich youth of faith and kindness. Following the death of his mother, with whom he spent most of his time, he seeked change 
      in his life. Following the call of Istus, he left the only town he had ever known, seeking a broader world-view, more challenging 
      issues of morality, and new ways to help people in need. <br>
      Resulting from his youth in a hometown where everyone knew their fellow townspeople, he is often unaware of how he presents himself 
      to others. Despite his bulky frame, graceless walk, rugged look, and hulking armor, he believes himself to be approachable and 
      welcoming. This lack of awareness carries through in his voice, and others are often confused at what he means to say. A purveyor 
      of bad jokes that do not land, awkward phrasing, things that should not be said, and the occasional shaky lie, Alistair is almost 
      always the last person to talk when it counts (if he knows what’s good for him). <br>
      In his current state, he is deeply devoted to his friends’ health and safety, and appreciates them for all of their flaws. He views 
      all of their differences as ways to learn, and believes strongly that Istus has deliberately chosen them to cross his path, so that 
      he can experience other life narratives, concepts of morality, and hardship. He hopes that in knowing them, he will become more 
      cosmopolitan, but also that it may be a mutually beneficial friendship, and that they can help them accept how fate has molded them.
