    <b>Bio:</b>Aloof, unassuming, and unsophisticated, Anaxir Khan is a monk, raised in a monastery in Browling. He and his older brother Zion are the children of Horatio and Roanna Khan, who were a local family of artisans before being killed by an individual only known as the Burning King. After the deaths of their parents, Anaxir and Zion were found by the monks, who raised them as part of their order. While Zion excelled in his studies, Anaxir was merely competent, preferring to spend his free time exploring the countryside, tooling around with an old piano, and interacting with new people. At age seventeen, a second confrontation with the Burning King led to a rift between Zion and Anaxir, and the two haven’t talked since. The trauma of the events sent Anaxir into a state of self-doubt and depression. He wrestled with the stress over others’ expectations of him, afraid he would be judged for not living up to the standard of his brother. Anaxir then spiraled into alcoholism to numb the feelings. He was initially a vagabond who drank (and punched) his problems away. As the alcoholism became a part of him, Anaxir turned his drunkenness from a weakness into a strength in combat, employing it in an unorthodox martial technique to overwhelm adversaries with potent speed and force. When he’s not fighting, his behavior varies. Sometimes, he becomes so drunk that he sounds and acts sober before passing out. Other times, he ends up in completely random places, without anyone (including himself) knowing how he got there. Years later, at age 23, Anaxir travels with his companions through Booklandia. He is slowly learning to not worry about the judgement of others, doing his best to be lawful good in his own strange way. He carries a mug of unending booze to keep his alcoholism afloat, taking the self-empowering title of a drunken master.
