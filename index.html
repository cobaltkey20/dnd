      <h1>Storybook Campaign</h1>
      Hi everyone! Here's a collection of art, music, and any other creative works produced by us that are related to
      the d&amp;d campaign from our sophmore year. This is a very simple webpage because I'm not super skilled with html yet, 
      but I hope you all like it! If I missed anything, be sure to let me know and I'll add it in! 
      <br>

      To navigate the page and search for specific works or categories, press Ctrl+F to open a search bar.
      
      <h2>Visual Art</h2>
      Comics, sketches, paintings, and jokes -- we've produced a lot of this stuff! I'll try to make it sequential, and if
      you want art by a specific artist, search their name with Ctrl+F. Because of some GroupMe glitch, some images were shrunken
      and lowered in quality when I transferred them here, so please, if this happened to a piece you did, DM me another picture of it
      and I'll replace the one here with it.
      
      <h3><i>Canon and Canon-adjacent</i></h3>
      Here's where all the things that happened in canon are, along with things that maybe didn't necessarily happen, but are set in
      (or based off of) the canon universe, more or less.

      <h3><i>Alternate Universe</i></h3>
      Here's pure AU content.
      
      
      <h2>Music</h2>
      All of this is by Henry! I think I speak for all of us when I say I'm blown away by the amount he's done and by the
      quality of it all!
