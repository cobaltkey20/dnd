      <h1>Larawyn Alenand</h1>
      <b>Race:</b> Half Elf <br>
      <b>Age:</b> 30 <br>
      <b>Alignment:</b> Chaotic Neutral <br>
      <b>Bio:</b>
      Larawyn's sharp edges and callousness are the result of a life characterized by loss and survival at any cost. 
      Her outwardly freewheeling and gregarious nature hides (with mixed success) an inner turmoil and bitterness about the fate of 
      her family. However, she greatly enjoys taking part in life's many pleasures, the greatest of which she considers to be adventuring, 
      fighting, drinking, and good company. In equal measures cautious and bold, she lives life to the fullest and tackles problems 
      with her quick blade or quicker wit. Though she knows that looking out for herself should come before everything else, she feels 
      more connected to her current companions with every day that passes, and her time with them is waking buried feelings of genuine 
      care and, perhaps, with time, selflessness. <br>
